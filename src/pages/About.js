        <dt>What is this?</dt>
        <dd>
          RedditPlayer creates playlists from any Reddit comment thread, subreddit or multi-reddit. Just replace <strong>reddit.com</strong> in any Reddit URL to <strong>rplayr.com</strong> and youâ€™re good.

        <dt>How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>
          The app is written using <a href={REACT_URL}>React</a>. It fetches stuff from Reddit using <a href={FETCH_REDDIT_URL}>fetch-reddit</a>, then <a href={REACT_PLAYER_URL}>react-player</a> plays any supported URLs. Playlists are curated by the mighty <a href={CURATION_URL}>u/evilnight</a> over at <a href={LISTENTOTHIS_URL}>r/listentothis</a>. See the <a href={REDDIT_PLAYER_URL}>source code</a> on GitHub.

        <dt>What about <a href='http://radd.it'>radd.it</a>, <a href='https://reddit.musicplayer.io'>reddit.musicplayer.io</a>, <a href='http://redditplaylister.phoenixforgotten.com'>redditplaylister</a>, etc?</dt>

          Yes, there are other apps that do the job. I wanted to create something simple with a clean, minimal interface. Also, this app fixes <a href='https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/issues/7'>issues</a> that other apps still suffer from.
